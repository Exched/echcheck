Moonton Account Checker using Python 3

## ℹ️ About

This program is a tool to check the login success of Moonton Mobile Legends accounts using the provided list of email and password combinations.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer. If not, you can download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Prepare a list of email and password combinations in the format `email:password` or `email|password`. Save the list in a text file, for example: `list.txt`.

3. Ensure that the `list.txt` file is in the same directory as the `main.py` file.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt, then navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.

5. Run the program by executing the following command in the terminal or command prompt:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```

6. The program will prompt you to enter the name of the file containing the list of email and password combinations (e.g., `list.txt`). Enter the file name and press Enter.

7. The program will start checking each account in the list. After completion, it will display the number of accounts that successfully logged in and failed to log in, and save the results in the `live.txt` (successful accounts) and `die.txt` (failed accounts) files.

8. That's it! You can open the `live.txt` file to view the accounts that successfully logged in, and `die.txt` to view the accounts that failed to log in.
